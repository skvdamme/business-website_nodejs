	<ul><p>S&S Spa strives to offer a unique experience. The Spa was founded on the philosophy that the synthesis of modern and traditional healing techniques in combination with natural products known for their healing and beauty properties create a fusion which ensures absolute relaxation and rejuvenation. Another principle S&S Spa strictly adheres to, is providing individually customized, attentive treatments with a quality of service rivaling five star Hotel Spas!</br>

	</br>The Spa’s owners Sophie van Wersch and Samantha van Damme, with their meticulous attention to details, have put in tremendous effort into building the Spa on this philosophy and more importantly staying true to the principles in every operational aspect of the Spa. The sleek modern design of the Spa merges with local natural building materials such as stone, wood and bamboo, providing the perfect, clean, comfortable ambience and setting for enjoying a variety of exceptionally relaxing and invigorating treatments.</br>

	</br>The aim for profit often overpowers quality in many Spas in Amsterdam, this is however not the case at S&S Spa. We pride ourself on our superior quality in treatments, service and products. We are perhaps the only Spa in Europe that can certify the use of 100% pure essential oil in its great selection of Massage Oils, which are freshly mixed in the Spa to ensure that guests can take full advantage of the benefits of the essential oils. This selection also includes an Ayurvedic Oil, which gets its healing qualities from the herbs and spices that are cooked in virgin coconut oil for two days according to ancient recipes!</br>

	</br>S&S Spa profits from Amsterdam’s long tradition in wellness, but further develops each therapist individually to ensure each achieves the remarkably high standards of this exceptional Spa. Although treatments such as the Balinese Massage or the Abhyanga Massage may be based on ancient rituals, each is developed in-­house at S&S Spa providing guests with an incredible, unique spa experience. It is believed at S&S Spa that well trained and content staff transmit positive energy throughout the Spa further enhancing the guest’s experience.</br>

	</br>S&S Spa is a young competitor in Amsterdam’s thriving Spa industry, only having opened in July 2011, but having entered the stage with such a passion for quality and excellence that it is rapidly becoming a front-­‐runner in the area. For more information, please visit the wonderful team at S&S Spa.</br>
